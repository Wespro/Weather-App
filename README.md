# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## Steps I made

### server-side:
1) Installed express and rquired it .
2) Start up an instance of app.
3) Installed and required cors and body parser and used them with app.use().
4)Setup Server.
5) Made a get route that returns porjectData.
6)Made a post route that puts data in projectData.

### client-side :

1) Got my Personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API.
2) Made a get reqest to fetch temp from weather api
3) Then postData to server-side with fetch.
4) Then got Data Opject from server with all data gathered by fetch.
5)addEventListner to Generate id and updating UI with data gathered to the user.
